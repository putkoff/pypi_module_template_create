## Overview

This Python script assists in the creation of a structured Python project and modules. The script generates a standard Python package structure, including setup files, READMEs, and licensing information. It's especially useful for package developers who need to quickly set up a new project or module.

The script features:

- Creation of directories for the project and its modules
- Automatic generation of Python files like `__init__.py` and `main.py` for each module
- Creation of `setup.py` files for package distribution
- Generation of a `LICENSE` file and a `.gitignore` file
- Installation and usage of Twine for package uploads
- Setup file installer for handling all Python packages

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you'll need:

- Python 3.6 or above installed on your system.
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to view and modify the script.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Save the script to a Python (.py) file on your local machine.
2. Modify the script's `project_name` and `modules` variables to specify your desired project and module names.
3. Run the script with Python. The script will generate the project structure with the necessary files in the same directory as the script.

## Structure

The generated project structure will look like this:

```
- Project_Name/
    - .gitignore
    - LICENSE
    - README.md
    - __init__.py
    - setup.py
    - setup_installer.py
    - pyproject.toml
    - src/
        - __init__.py
        - Module_Name/
            - .gitignore
            - LICENSE
            - README.md
            - __init__.py
            - requirements.txt
            - setup.py
            - pyproject.toml
            - src/
                - __init__.py
                - main.py
```

Each module will have its own setup file, allowing it to be installed and distributed individually.

## Future Work

In future versions, we aim to extend the script's functionality to support more complex project structures and additional features such as automatic generation of unit tests and continuous integration configuration files.
